## Hi there 👋☕  
I'm João, a Brazilian developer who loves turning coffee into code. I'm passionate about building software that solves real-world problems — making life easier.

### What I Do 🛠️  
**Back-end Development:** Java, Spring Boot, and Node.js are my main tools for building robust and scalable applications.

**Full-stack Capabilities:** I’m also comfortable on the front-end with TypeScript and React when needed.

**Cloud & Architecture:** I design cloud-native solutions on AWS and work with microservices, event-driven systems, and clean architecture principles.

### What I'm Exploring 🔍  
Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into:  
- ⚡ **Generative AI** – not just LLMs, but also RAG, system integration, and real-world use cases  
- 🧱 **Software Architecture** – domain-driven design, observability, and performance  
- ⚙️ **Dev Productivity** – automation, testing strategies, and developer experience  

### My Philosophy 💡  
I believe in building software that’s not just functional — but valuable, clean, and user-focused. Code should be elegant, maintainable, and built with purpose.

### Let’s Connect 🌐  
Raech me out on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaoac/)! I'm always open to a chat about tech, coffee, music or the next big thing in software development.
