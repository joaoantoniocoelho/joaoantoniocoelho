## Hi there 👋☕
I'm João, a Brazilian developer who loves to turn coffee into code. I'm all about solving real-world problems through software, making life just a bit easier for everyone.

### What I Do 🛠️
**Back-end Development:** Java, Spring Boot and NodeJS are my main tools for building robust and scalable applications.

**Full-stack Work:** I can also handle the front-end when needed, with experience in TypeScript and React.

### My Philosophy 💡
I believe in creating software that not only works but makes a difference. I'm all about clean, efficient code that gets the job done, with a focus on user-friendly experiences.

### Let’s Connect 🌐
Currently, I'm building awesome stuff at  [SAP](https://sap.com/). But I'm always open to a chat about tech, coffee, music or the next big thing in software development.
